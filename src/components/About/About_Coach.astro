            <h2>Meet Ronan – Founder and Head Coach</h2>
            <p>
                Ronan started Soccer Every Day Academy with one goal in mind, to
                give players of all levels the tools they need to grow. With
                years of coaching experience across Australia, Europe and Asia,
                Ronan blends global football knowledge with a local,
                player-first approach.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
                Backed by a background in sports science, Ronan’s sessions focus
                on technical skills, football IQ, physical development and
                confidence. He currently coaches at Terrigal FC and the Terrigal
                Development Centre, working with players from beginners right
                through to rep level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ronan believes in more than just drills. He believes in building
                footballers who love the game, think fast and play with purpose.
